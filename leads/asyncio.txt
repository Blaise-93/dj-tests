Asyncio is a Python module that provides a way to write concurrent code using coroutines, 
which are functions that can suspend and resume their execution. Asyncio can help you
 improve the performance and responsiveness of
 your Django applications by allowing you to run non-blocking IO operations, such as
  HTTP requests, database queries, or file operations, without blocking the main thread.

Django has support for writing asynchronous views, which are views that return 
a coroutine instead of a regular function. You can declare an async view by using 
async def for your view function or your class-based view methods, such as get() 
or post(). For example:


from asgiref.sync import sync_to_async
import aiohttp

# An async view that uses the ORM
async def my_view(request):
    results = await sync_to_async(MyModel.objects.filter)(name="foo")
    return HttpResponse(f"There are {len(results)} objects named foo.")


# A function-based async view
async def my_view(request):
    # Some async code
    return HttpResponse("Hello, async world!")

# A class-based async view
class MyView(View):
    async def get(self, request):
    # Some async code
    return HttpResponse("Hello, async world!")

import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def main():

    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get('http://python.org') as response:

            print("Status:", response.status)
            print("Content-type:", response.headers['content-type'])

            html = await response.text()
            print("Body:", html[:15], "...")

  asyncio.run(main())

# examples/server_simple.py
from aiohttp import web

async def handle(request):
    name = request.match_info.get('name', "Anonymous")
    text = "Hello, " + name
    return web.Response(text=text)

async def wshandle(request):
    ws = web.WebSocketResponse()
    await ws.prepare(request)

    async for msg in ws:
        if msg.type == web.WSMsgType.text:
            await ws.send_str("Hello, {}".format(msg.data))
        elif msg.type == web.WSMsgType.binary:
            await ws.send_bytes(msg.data)
        elif msg.type == web.WSMsgType.close:
            break

    return ws


app = web.Application()
app.add_routes([web.get('/', handle),
                web.get('/echo', wshandle),
                web.get('/{name}', handle)])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    web.run_app(app)


Async views will work under both WSGI and ASGI servers, but you will 
only get the full benefits of an async stack if you use ASGI, which is a 
standard for running asynchronous web applications. ASGI allows you to handle
 hundreds of concurrent connections without using Python threads, and to use 
 features like streaming, long-polling, and websockets. You can deploy Django using 
 ASGI by using a compatible server, such as Daphne, Uvicorn, or Hypercorn.

If you want to use asyncio in your Django views, you will need to be aware of 
some limitations and challenges. First of all, not all parts of Django are async-ready yet.
 For example, the ORM and the template engine are still synchronous, and you will need to
  wrap them in a sync_to_async() call if you want to use them in an async context. This
 function will run the synchronous code in a separate thread and return an awaitable
  object. For example:

Secondly, you will need to make sure that your async code is thread-safe, since it
 may run in different threads depending on the 
server configuration. This means that you should avoid using global variables or shared 
state that may cause race conditions or data corruption. You should also be careful with 
libraries or modules that are not designed for async use, such as time.sleep() or requests.
 Instead, you should use the asyncio equivalents, such as asyncio.sleep() or aiohttp.

Thirdly, you will need to learn how to use the asyncio API and its features, 
such as tasks, futures, events, queues, locks, and more. These are the building 
blocks of writing concurrent and parallel code with asyncio, and they can help you manage 
the execution flow and the communication between your coroutines. You can find more information and examples in the official documentation of asyncio.

There are many resources and tutorials that can help you learn how to use asyncio in Django. 
Here are some of them:

 how to use async views and middleware in Django.

answer on how to use asyncio to run a periodic task in a Django view.

async view in Django,
 make a non-blocking HTTP request, simplify basic background tasks, and use sync_to_async.
